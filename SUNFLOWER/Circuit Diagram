We (upon searching) the internet found out that our project's circuitry is very similary to this tutorial's circuit diagram 
(https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-solar-panel-tracker) with minor changes as mentioned.

The Link to the circuit diagram is given as:

Change : Please donot connect wires and 9V batttery as shown in diagram to Vin pin and ground pin of Arduino Uno.
