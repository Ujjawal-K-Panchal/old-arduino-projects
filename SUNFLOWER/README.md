# Description : 

This is an Arduino based project designed to improve the traditional Solar Panel based systems. 
Motivation for this is drawn from the phototrophic movement of sunflowers(it means facing of sunflower towards the sun).

# Requirements : 

1. Arduino Uno/Mega & Arduino to Computer cable.
2. Circuit elements in accordance with the circuit diagram.
3. A Computer for programming arduino.

# Guidelines : 

1. Connect the circuit as shown in the image.
2. Compile and Upload the code to arduino which is present in present in Sunflower.ino
3. Connect Arduino Uno/Mega to an external power supply (preferable 9V for Uno), place the Sunflower system in an 
   appropriate location.
4. Connect Output of Solar Panel to a storage unit.
